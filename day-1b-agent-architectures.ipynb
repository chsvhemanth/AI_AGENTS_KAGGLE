    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model.

      "One of the most significant advantages of MAS lies in **enhanced problem-solving through specialization and collaboration**. Complex challenges can be broken down into smaller, manageable units, with each specialized agent tackling its part. This division of labor facilitates parallel processing and accelerates development cycles. Furthermore, MAS leverage **distributed intelligence**, where the collective \"wisdom\" of multiple agents can tackle problems far beyond the scope of a single entity. Agents continuously share information and learn from each other's experiences, fostering a truly collaborative environment. This distributed nature also lends itself to remarkable **adaptability and resilience**. If one agent encounters an issue or fails, others can often compensate, ensuring the system remains functional and minimizing single points of failure.\n",

      "Beyond problem-solving, MAS drive **increased efficiency and automation in development workflows**. Think of agents autonomously handling **automated testing and debugging**, identifying, reporting, and even attempting to fix bugs, drastically reducing manual effort.

Moreover, these systems excel at **intelligent resource management**, monitoring performance, dynamically allocating resources, and proactively identifying potential bottlenecks before they impact users.\n",

They enable sophisticated **complex simulations and modeling**, where independent agents interact to mimic real-world phenomena, leading to richer insights.

      "2.  **Embedded Finance:** This trend involves integrating financial services directly into non-financial platforms, offering seamless experiences for consumers. It spans payments, lending, and insurance, significantly growing the market by making financial products accessible at the point of need.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Leveraging blockchain and cryptocurrencies, DeFi aims to democratize financial systems by removing intermediaries. It's experiencing substantial investment and growth, with applications in lending, trading, and cross-border payments, though regulatory clarity remains a key factor.\n",

This wasn't just any paper; it pulsed with a faint, emerald light, casting eerie shadows on the stone walls of his lighthouse. He unrolled it, revealing not lines and familiar coastlines, but a swirling nebula of luminous ink. Strange symbols, like constellations he’d never seen, dotted the surface. A single, glowing X marked a spot deep within the unknown. Elias, a man who’d spent fifty years guiding ships safely through the fog, felt a tremor of something ancient and powerful stir within him. The sea, which had always been his domain, had just whispered a secret.\n",

      "1.  **Elaborate on Elias's reaction and internal state.** While you mention a \"tremor of something ancient and powerful,\" you could deepen this by showing Elias's immediate thoughts, questions, or even his initial disbelief. Is he curious, frightened, excited? Fifty years of routine might make such a discovery even more jarring.\n",
      "2.  **Hint at the origin or purpose of the map.** The map is discovered, but *why* is it a glowing nebula with strange symbols? Is it magical, alien, or something else entirely? A subtle hint, even a question Elias asks himself, could add more intrigue.\n",
      "3.  **Introduce a hint of immediate consequence or action.** The \"glowing X\" suggests a destination. While the story is short, a brief thought from Elias about what this might mean for him, or a small, immediate action he takes (like examining the map more closely under the lamplight), could propel the reader forward.\n",

The sea, which had always been his domain, his constant companion, had just whispered a secret, a dangerous, tantalizing secret that made the very air in the lighthouse crackle with an ancient power. He leaned closer, his practical mind struggling to grasp the impossible. What lay at that glowing X? And more importantly, what was he, Elias, a simple keeper of the light, supposed to do about it? He squinted, tracing the glowing lines with a trembling finger, a sense of profound unease and exhilarating curiosity warring within him.
