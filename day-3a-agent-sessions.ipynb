    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and promising areas for AI in healthcare. Here are some of the *newer developments and ongoing trends* that are making waves:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design (De Novo Drug Design):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Beyond Optimization:** While AI has been used to optimize existing drug candidates for a while, generative AI models (like those based on GANs or diffusion models) are now creating entirely *new* molecular structures from scratch. These models can be trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties, then instructed to design molecules that are predicted to bind to specific targets, have desired pharmacokinetic properties (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes the drug), and are less likely to be toxic.\n",
      "*   **Accelerated Exploration:** This dramatically speeds up the initial \"hit identification\" phase, where researchers are looking for promising starting points. Instead of sifting through millions of existing compounds, AI can propose novel ones tailored to the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Multi-Omics Integration:** AI is becoming much better at integrating and analyzing data from various \"omics\" – genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. By looking at the interplay between these different molecular layers, AI can identify more precise disease targets that might have been missed by traditional methods.\n",
      "*   **Causal Inference:** Newer AI techniques are focusing on identifying causal relationships between biological factors and disease, rather than just correlations. This helps pinpoint the most impactful targets for intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Predictive Modeling for Pre-clinical and Clinical Success:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **\"In Silico\" Trials:** AI is being used to build sophisticated models that can predict drug efficacy and toxicity *before* expensive and time-consuming lab experiments or clinical trials. This helps prioritize the most promising candidates and de-prioritize those likely to fail, saving immense resources.\n",
      "*   **Patient Stratification for Clinical Trials:** AI can analyze patient data (genetics, biomarkers, clinical history) to identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to respond to a particular drug. This leads to smaller, faster, and more successful clinical trials, and ultimately, more targeted therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. AI in Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Unlocking New Therapies:** AI can rapidly scan existing approved drugs and predict whether they might be effective against new diseases. This is a much faster and often cheaper route to new treatments, as the safety profiles of these drugs are already well-established.\n",
      "*   **Identifying Novel Mechanisms:** AI can also uncover new mechanisms of action for existing drugs, leading to unexpected therapeutic applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Improved Understanding of Disease Mechanisms:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Network Biology and Systems Pharmacology:** AI helps researchers build complex models of biological networks and disease pathways. This provides a deeper understanding of how diseases develop and progress, which is crucial for identifying effective intervention points.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Disease Models:** AI can help create individualized models of disease for specific patients, paving the way for truly personalized treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Companies and Technologies Leading the Way:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several companies are at the forefront, leveraging AI for drug discovery. Some notable examples include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to map human cellular structures and identify drug candidates.\n",
      "*   **Exscientia:** Employs AI to design novel drug molecules and optimize them for clinical development.\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** Focuses on generative AI for target discovery and molecule design, famously having brought an AI-discovered drug into clinical trials rapidly.\n",
      "*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, predicting how molecules will bind to targets.\n",
      "*   **BenevolentAI:** Leverages AI to analyze vast amounts of scientific literature and data to identify potential drug targets and therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The \"Why Now\":**\n",
      "\n",
      "These advancements are possible due to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Massive Data Availability:** The explosion of biological data (genomics, proteomics, electronic health records, scientific literature) provides the fuel for AI.\n",
      "*   **Algorithmic Improvements:** Significant progress in machine learning and deep learning techniques.\n",
      "*   **Computational Power:** Increased accessibility to powerful computing resources (GPUs, cloud computing).\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI is transforming drug discovery from a largely empirical, trial-and-error process into a more predictive, data-driven, and efficient endeavor.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**. This is a crucial step in drug discovery, as identifying the right biological target is the first hurdle to developing an effective therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive into what's happening in this area:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A drug target is typically a molecule in the body (like a protein, enzyme, or gene) that plays a key role in a disease process. By designing a drug that interacts with this target (either activating or inhibiting it), we aim to correct the underlying problem and treat the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Enhancing Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, target identification relied on a combination of deep biological expertise, painstaking laboratory experiments, and often, serendipity. AI is revolutionizing this by enabling us to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Integrate and Analyze Multi-Omics Data:**\n",
      "    *   **The Challenge:** A single disease can be influenced by a complex interplay of genetic mutations, changes in gene expression, protein activity, and metabolic pathways. Analyzing these different layers of biological information separately is like trying to understand a symphony by listening to only one instrument.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** AI algorithms excel at integrating diverse datasets, including:\n",
      "        *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences, mutations, variations.\n",
      "        *   **Transcriptomics:** RNA expression levels (which genes are turned \"on\" or \"off\").\n",
      "        *   **Proteomics:** Protein levels and their modifications.\n",
      "        *   **Metabolomics:** Levels of small molecules involved in metabolism.\n",
      "        *   **Clinical Data:** Patient symptoms, disease progression, treatment responses.\n",
      "    *   **The Outcome:** By analyzing these integrated datasets, AI can identify molecular pathways that are consistently dysregulated in diseased states, pointing towards potential targets that influence multiple aspects of the disease. For example, AI might find a specific protein whose increased expression (proteomics) is linked to a particular gene mutation (genomics) and leads to a cascade of metabolic changes (metabolomics) associated with disease severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Identify Causal Relationships, Not Just Correlations:**\n",
      "    *   **The Challenge:** Many biological studies reveal correlations – \"this happens when that happens.\" But correlation doesn't equal causation. A molecule might be present in higher amounts during a disease, but it might be a consequence of the disease, not a cause.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** Advanced AI techniques, including **causal inference models** and **graph neural networks**, are being developed to move beyond simple correlations. These models try to understand the underlying \"cause-and-effect\" relationships within biological networks.\n",
      "    *   **The Outcome:** By identifying true causal links, AI helps researchers pinpoint the drivers of disease, making the identified targets more likely to be effective when modulated by a drug. This reduces the risk of pursuing targets that are bystanders rather than key players.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Literature Mining:**\n",
      "    *   **The Challenge:** The sheer volume of published scientific research is overwhelming. It's impossible for any human or even a team of humans to read and synthesize everything relevant to a particular disease or target.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** NLP-powered AI systems can scan millions of research papers, patents, and clinical trial reports. They can extract relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and potential therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "    *   **The Outcome:** This helps uncover hidden connections and novel hypotheses that might have been missed by manual review. AI can identify emerging trends or under-explored areas that suggest new target opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Uncover Novel Biology and Disease Mechanisms:**\n",
      "    *   **The Challenge:** Our understanding of complex diseases is often incomplete. New biological pathways are constantly being discovered.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Role:** By modeling biological systems in an unbiased way, AI can reveal entirely new mechanisms or sub-types of diseases that were not previously recognized. This can lead to the identification of novel classes of targets.\n",
      "    *   **The Outcome:** This is particularly powerful for complex diseases like Alzheimer's, autoimmune disorders, or certain cancers, where single-gene explanations are often insufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Increased Confidence:** AI-driven target identification provides researchers with a higher degree of confidence that they are pursuing the right biological pathways.\n",
      "*   **Reduced Failure Rates:** By identifying more robust and causally relevant targets early on, AI can help reduce the high failure rates in later stages of drug development.\n",
      "*   **Discovery of Novel Targets:** AI is particularly good at finding targets for diseases where traditional approaches have struggled, opening up new avenues for treating unmet medical needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This development in target identification is a foundational piece that enables many other AI-driven advancements in drug discovery, such as designing molecules to hit these identified targets.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",

      "User > Who are the main companies involved in that?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of **AI-driven target identification and validation**.

Their platform is designed to uncover hidden insights and generate new hypotheses.\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** They have a strong AI platform that spans target discovery, molecule generation, and clinical development. Their target discovery engine is crucial for their end-to-end approach, and they leverage multi-omics data to find novel targets.\n",
      "*   **Schrödinger:** Primarily known for its physics-based computational platform for molecular modeling, Schrödinger has been expanding its AI capabilities. They use AI to enhance their physics-based simulations and analyze large biological datasets to improve target identification and validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Companies with a Focus on Specific Biological Data Types or AI Approaches for Target ID:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Genentech (a member of the Roche Group):** As a major biopharmaceutical company, Genentech has been a leader in leveraging advanced computational approaches, including AI, for target identification, particularly in oncology and immunology, often integrated with their extensive genomics and proteomics efforts.\n",
      "*   **Sanofi:** Similar to Genentech, Sanofi is a large pharmaceutical company that is investing heavily in AI across its R&D pipeline, including sophisticated target identification strategies that integrate diverse biological data.\n",
      "*   **Novartis:** Another pharmaceutical giant, Novartis is known for its significant investments in AI and machine learning for drug discovery, which naturally includes advanced target identification and validation techniques.\n",
      "*   **Astellas Pharma:** They have been actively partnering with AI-focused companies and building internal AI capabilities to accelerate target identification and discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Specialized AI/Biotech Startups and Emerging Players:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Crestone Bio:** This company focuses on using AI to analyze single-cell multi-omics data to discover novel targets and biomarkers, particularly for complex diseases.\n",
      "*   **TwoXAR:** While they have pivoted somewhat, TwoXAR was an early player using AI to predict drug-target interactions and identify novel therapeutic opportunities.\n",
      "*   **Relay Therapeutics:** They use quantitative biophysics and computational approaches, increasingly augmented by AI, to understand protein motion and identify targets within these dynamic processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Partnerships:** Many pharmaceutical giants (like Pfizer, Merck, GSK) are also actively involved, often through strategic partnerships with specialized AI drug discovery companies or by building their own internal AI teams.\n",
      "*   **Evolution:** The landscape is rapidly evolving. Companies that started with a narrow AI focus are broadening their platforms, and traditional pharma is increasingly adopting AI.\n",
      "*   **Overlap:** It's rare for a company to focus *solely* on target ID. Most companies involved in AI drug discovery will have capabilities that span target identification, molecule design, and optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "When looking at companies, it's useful to see if they have a public pipeline or highlight specific technologies related to biological data integration, causal inference, or advanced literature mining as part of their platform for identifying and validating therapeutic targets.\n"

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",
